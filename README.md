# Lab01 - Sallen Key Active Filter
The purpose of this lab is to build sallen key active filter aka second order low pass filter.
I'll be using LTSpice simulation to verify my caculation and circuitry. After the simulation, I'll be measuring dataset through oscilloscope to verify it further.
At the end of this lab, I organized through using Matlab live script and simulate it through matlab using the measured & ideal values that I obtained.
